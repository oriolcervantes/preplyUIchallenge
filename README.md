# Your Herbarium
This is my solution to the coding challenge posed by Preply. It consists on developing a basic UI based on a Figma prototype. The design is mobile-only.

## How to run it
This app runs on React, and it has been initialized by means of create-react-app. To run in on your local machine, do the following:
* Fork this repository and clone it on your local machine.
* Run `npm install` both on the `root` directory and on `/client`, to install the dependencies.
* When in `/client`, run `npm start`. The app will run on `localhost:3000`.

This app does not include a back end nor feeds from one. The necessary data is in the front end.
